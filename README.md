This game is programed with ActionScript programming language. LEFT arrow, RIGHT arrow and UP arrow will give the characters direction. Where left and right button will make move it and up button is for jump. Avoid the spike and the pacpac, those will make you restart from the begining again. 

This file is in swf format. Not in exe. It is comfortable to run it in your midia player. KM4 or VLC or windows media plyer all are good to run it.
